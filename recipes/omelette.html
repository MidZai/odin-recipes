      <li>Gather the Ingredients</li>
      <li>
        Whisk eggs, water, and salt together in a mixing bowl. Whisk until
        mixture is very liquid and whites are completely blended in, 1 or 2
        minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Heat 1 ½ tablespoons butter in a 9- or 10-inch nonstick skillet over
        medium-high heat. As soon as butter melts and before it starts to
        sizzle, pour in whisked eggs. Stir in a circular pattern with a
        heat-proof spatula, lifting and scrambling eggs, shaking the pan to keep
        leveling out the mixture, and scraping down the sides. Continue stirring
        until shaking the pan no longer levels the eggs.

        Reduce heat to low. Using the spatula, smooth the surface to move runny
        eggs to less runny spots, working toward an even thickness. As soon as
        the surface is wet but not runny, remove from heat.
      </li>
      <li>
        Starting at the handle side of the pan, use the spatula to begin rolling
        omelette into a cylinder shape, about 3 rolls until omelette is about 2
        inches from opposite side of the pan. Use the spatula to fold the last
        flap of egg over the top of the cylinder leaving the seam-side up. Add
        remaining 1/2 tablespoon butter to the pan. Gently push the butter as it
        melts under the omelette.
