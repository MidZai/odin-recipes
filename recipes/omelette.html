      <h2>How to make an Omelette step by step</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>Gather the Ingredients</li>
        <li>
          Whisk eggs, water, and salt together in a mixing bowl. Whisk until
          mixture is very liquid and whites are completely blended in, 1 or 2
          minutes.
        </li>
        <li>
          Heat 1 ½ tablespoons butter in a 9- or 10-inch nonstick skillet over
          medium-high heat. As soon as butter melts and before it starts to
          sizzle, pour in whisked eggs. Stir in a circular pattern with a
          heat-proof spatula, lifting and scrambling eggs, shaking the pan to
          keep leveling out the mixture, and scraping down the sides. Continue
          stirring until shaking the pan no longer levels the eggs.
        </li>
        <li>
          Reduce heat to low. Using the spatula, smooth the surface to move
          runny eggs to less runny spots, working toward an even thickness. As
          soon as the surface is wet but not runny, remove from heat.
        </li>
        <li>
          Starting at the handle side of the pan, use the spatula to begin
          rolling omelette into a cylinder shape, about 3 rolls until omelette
          is about 2 inches from opposite side of the pan. Use the spatula to
          fold the last flap of egg over the top of the cylinder leaving the
          seam-side up. Add remaining 1/2 tablespoon butter to the pan. Gently
          push the butter as it melts under the omelette.
