        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>
          This recipe is made with mutton and chicken, but you can easily change
          the meats for lamb and/or merguez. I make this often and my family
          loves it!
        </p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>

        <h2>How to make couscous royal step-by-step</h2>
        <ol>
          <li>
            Heat 3 tablespoons olive oil in a large pot over medium-high heat.
            Season mutton chops and chicken drumsticks with salt and pepper;
            cook in batches with onions in the hot oil until browned, about 2
            minutes per side. Transfer to a large plate.
          </li>
          <li>
            Scrape the bottom of the pot with a wooden spoon to release browned
            bits. Return mutton chops and chicken to the pot. Pour in enough
            water to cover; add turmeric, cumin, and coriander. Cover and bring
            to a boil. Reduce heat to medium; simmer for 20 minutes.
          </li>
          <li>
            Stir potatoes, turnips, and carrots into the pot. Simmer, covered,
            until vegetables start to soften, about 10 minutes. Mix in tomato
            paste and ras el hanout; cook for 10 minutes. Stir in chickpeas,
            zucchini, and cilantro; continue cooking, covered, until zucchini is
            tender, about 5 minutes.
          </li>
          <li>
            Bring 3 cups water to a boil in a saucepan; remove from heat and
            stir in couscous and butter. Cover saucepan and let stand until
            water is absorbed completely, 5 to 10 minutes. Fluff couscous with a
            fork and stir in 1 tablespoon olive oil. Transfer to a serving dish.
          </li>
          <li>
            Ladle 2 scoops of cooking liquid into a bowl; mix in harissa until
            smooth.
          </li>
          <li>
            Scoop vegetables onto a serving plate. Scoop mutton and chicken onto
            a separate plate. Serve alongside couscous, harissa sauce, and
            remaining cooking liquid in the pot.
